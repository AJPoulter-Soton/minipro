An open source program for controlling the MiniPRO TL866xx series of chip programmers

## Features
* Compatibility with Minipro TL866CS and Minipro TL866A from
Autoelectric (http://www.autoelectric.cn/)
* More than 13000 target devices (including AVRs, PICs, various BIOSes and EEPROMs)
* ZIF40 socket and ISP support
* Vendor-specific MCU configuration bits
* Chip ID verification
* Overcurrent protection
* System testing

## Synopsis

```nohighlight
$ minipro -p ATMEGA48 -w atmega48.bin
$ minipro -p ATMEGA48 -r atmega48.bin
```

## Prerequisites

You'll need some sort of Linux or MacOS machine.  Other Unices may work,
though that is untested.  You will need version 1.0.16 or greater of
libusb.


## Compiling for Linux (Debian, Ubuntu etc.)
1. Install build dependencies: `sudo apt-get install build-essential git libusb-1.0-0-dev`

2. Compile:
```nohighlight
git clone https://github.com/vdudouyt/minipro.git
cd minipro
make
sudo make install
```
3. (Recommended) If you want to access the programmer as a regular user,
you'll have to configure udev to recognize the programmer and set
appropriate access permissions:
```nohighlight
sudo cp udev/rules.d/80-minipro.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm trigger
```
You'll also have to add your regular user to the `plugdev` system
group:
```nohighlight
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev YOUR-USER
```
Note that this change will only become effective after your next
login.

4. (Optional) There is also a bash-completion file that you can install with 
```nohighlight
sudo cp bash_completion.d/minipro /etc/bash_completion.d/
```

### Making a .deb package

Building a Debian package directly from this repository is easy.  Make
sure you have the packages described above installed.  Be sure it all
builds, then do this:

```nohighlight
sudo apt-get install fakeroot dpkg-dev
fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -b --no-sign
```

You should then have a .deb package for you to install with 
`dpkg -i`. Note that the .deb package will already provide the udev
and bash-completion configurations for you.

## Compiling on macOS

Install `libusb` using brew or MacPorts:
```
brew install libusb
brew link libusb
```
or:
```
port install libusb
```

Compile using macOS Makefile:
```
make -f Makefile.macOS
sudo make install
```
